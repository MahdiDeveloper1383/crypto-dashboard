XRP Price Chooses Best Scenario appeared on BitcoinEthereumNews.com.Fourth biggest cryptocurrency XRP has been on a downward slide against Bitcoin for months, moving from highs near 0.00003100 BTC down to about 0.00002300 BTC. The drop looked heavy, but the current zone is starting to show signs of being a bottom. The relative strength index (RSI), which measures momentum, is now deep in oversold territory and looks similar to conditions seen earlier this year, right before XRP had one of its best rallies of 2025. XRP/BTC by TradingView The chart shows that sellers pushed XRP/BTC to new lows, but buyers quickly stepped in and the pair bounced. When the market recovers so quickly, it often means that demand is strong enough to keep things afloat. In the past, these moments have led to rebounds that lasted weeks. Best scenario for XRP/BTC If this level holds, XRP could climb back to 0.00002600 BTC in the short run, and potentially retest the summer highs if momentum builds. With Bitcoin trading at nearly $122,000, a move to 0.00002600 BTC would put XRP at around $3.17. If the rally keeps going and XRP/BTC goes back to 0.00002900 BTC, that would mean XRP getting closer to $3.54. For Bitcoin holders, this setup is mostly about maintaining a strong dominance. For XRP traders, it’s about spotting a possible turning point that doesn’t come around often. If the bottom is going to reset the whole picture of the last months, this could be the best-case scenario.

With a 10x leverage structure that is typical of perpetual futures, analysts estimate the actual liquidation level is more in the range of $86,000-87,000. This computation will indicate whether Bitcoin increases sharply, e.g. over $115,000 the trader might experience margin pressure or liquidation; it will depend on funding rates.Bitcoin PriceAt 1.41 PM IST (8:11 UTC), Bitcoin is within the range of $110,000 and 115,000 but it is in consolidation mode after a rampant climb to new heights. Cryptocurrency analysts see this brief as a warning to professional traders following the upsurge record of Bitcoin. Although the size of the $11.93K bet is quite modest, and its placement was by a top-ranked trader by PnL, its importance is that it reflects the confidence levels of the market at large on decentralized exchanges.Hyperliquid: Decentralized Futures TradingHyperliquid is a Layer 1 model of a decentralized exchange (DEX) that trades over 100 spot and perpetual pairs. All the trades on Hyperliquid are on-chain, unlike centralized exchanges like Binance or Bybit, and this guarantees the full transparency and verifiable history of performance of top traders. The platform regulates perpetual contract prices basing on funding rates to ensure that they are in line with the spot price of Bitcoin. Short traders typically pay funding charges to longs during bullish periods which may marginally destroy profit margins as time passes.The short at 110,297.00 that the trader has taken reflects the strategic bearish attitude that came after the record highs of Bitcoin. However, the liquidation price reported of $867,633.09 is definitely not accurate but the very fact of the trade itself highlights the increased cautiousness of the high-ranking traders. As Bitcoin solidifies between an $110K and volatility continues, this action may serve as a harbinger of a downward price impact or a general cooling down period in the cryptocurrency market.The post Top Hyperliquid Trader Shorts Bitcoin at $110K, Betting on Market Reversal appeared first on Coinfomania.",2025-10-11 09:36:13,UTC,,,coinfomania,Coinfomania,5766846,https://coinfomania.com,https://n.bytvi.com/crypto/coinfomania.jpg,english,['BTC'],positive,"{'positive': 85.08, 'neutral': 7.87, 'negative': 7.05}",['competition'],False

Despite impressive institutional demand, derivative markets are sending signals of caution. Bitcoin’s price, which reached an all-time high earlier in the week, struggled to regain momentum. The market uncertainty is compounded by broader economic concerns, such as fears surrounding the US-China trade war and growing inflation risks, which have influenced both Bitcoin and traditional financial markets.Bitcoin ETF Inflows Show Institutional ConfidenceBitcoin’s spot ETFs have seen a substantial increase in investment this month, with over $5 billion in net inflows. This surge indicates a strong demand from institutional investors, suggesting that Bitcoin still holds appeal for large players in the market. Investors seem to view Bitcoin as a store of value amid economic uncertainty.However, despite the positive inflow data, Bitcoin’s derivatives market presents a more cautious outlook. Futures and options markets, which are often used to speculate on Bitcoin’s price direction, have shown little change in recent days.The 60-day futures annualized premium remains at a modest 7%, far below the 10% mark seen during periods of strong optimism. This suggests that traders remain uncertain about Bitcoin’s immediate price direction, even as spot ETFs continue to attract investment.Bitcoin Derivatives Signal Market CautionThe data from Bitcoin derivatives markets shows that traders are not fully convinced of the price rally’s sustainability. The 25% delta skew, a measure of downside risk, has climbed to 8%, indicating that traders are hedging against potential price drops. This shift suggests that there is still some hesitance in the market, despite the positive ETF flows.The premium on monthly Bitcoin futures has stayed relatively flat over the past week, reflecting a lack of fresh bullish sentiment. In the past, when traders were more confident, this premium would often rise above 10%. The limited movement in this key indicator points to the fact that many traders are not fully embracing Bitcoin’s recent gains, instead remaining cautious and waiting for more stability in the market.Broader Economic Concerns Weigh on Bitcoin SentimentBitcoin’s price trajectory is closely tied to broader economic and geopolitical factors. The surge in gold prices, hitting a record high of nearly $4,050, signals that investors are seeking safe-haven assets amid ongoing fiscal challenges in the United States. The US-China trade tensions, in particular, have sparked concerns that worsening relations could impact corporate earnings, especially in tech sectors like artificial intelligence.Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional financial markets, especially the S&P 500, remains significant. Currently, Bitcoin’s relationship with the S&P 500 stands at 73%, which suggests that Bitcoin’s price is being influenced by the same risk factors affecting global equities. As the stock market faces increased uncertainty, traders may be reluctant to take on additional risk, keeping Bitcoin’s price movements restrained.Stablecoin Behavior Reflects Investor CautionStablecoins, such as Tether (USDT), have also provided insight into Bitcoin traders’ sentiment. When traders are nervous about the market, stablecoins tend to trade at a slight discount to the US dollar. This occurred earlier this week, as Bitcoin’s price dipped below $120,000. However, after the price drop, the discount dissipated, indicating that traders were less inclined to exit the market entirely.The movement of stablecoins in relation to Bitcoin provides valuable information about market confidence. When traders seek liquidity and exit positions, it often results in a discount for stablecoins. The return to parity between Tether and the US dollar suggests that some traders are holding steady, refraining from large exits despite Bitcoin’s price fluctuations.Bitcoin’s derivatives market remains cautious, even as ETFs experience strong inflows. This divergence reflects the ongoing uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin’s price, influenced by macroeconomic factors and broader market sentiment. While institutional demand remains strong, traders are wary of potential downside risks, keeping Bitcoin’s price under pressure despite a week of positive ETF activity.The post Bitcoin Struggles for Momentum as Derivatives Signal Hesitation Despite ETF Inflows appeared first on CoinCentral.",2025-10-11 09:35:42,UTC,https://coincentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-09-43-24-Missed-Out-On-Bitcoin-This-New-Trending-Altcoin-Could-Produce-5-000_-Returns-Before-January-Google-Docs.png,,coincentral,Coin Central,614223,http://coincentral.com/news,https://n.bytvi.com/crypto/coincentral.jpg,english,['BTC'],negative,"{'positive': 0.11, 'neutral': 2.3, 'negative': 97.6}","['technical analysis', 'liquidity']",False

What began as a simple question, “Should we hold Bitcoin?”, has now expanded into a more complex debate: Ether vs Bitcoin Treasuries . The contrast between the two assets has never been sharper. Bitcoin remains the benchmark for scarcity and digital permanence. Ethereum, on the other hand, has matured into a productive asset capable of generating real yield. For corporate treasurers and institutional allocators, the conversation is no longer about choosing one over the other. It’s about deciding which mix best fits the strategy: long-term preservation, yield optimization, or on-chain participation. Bitcoin’s Fortress Model Still Holds Ground For more than a decade, Bitcoin has been the undisputed reserve of the crypto world. Its fixed supply of 21 million coins gives it the kind of mathematical scarcity that central banks could only dream of. Institutional holdings now represent roughly 4 percent of Bitcoin’s total supply , translating to about 848,000 BTC valued at around $105 billion . This figure includes corporate treasuries, public companies, and ETF reserves. To traditional institutions, Bitcoin offers something beautifully simple: no yield, no governance risks, no moving parts. It’s a store of value that sits outside inflationary systems. An asset manager recently summarized it on X: “Bitcoin is not just digital gold. It’s the first asset you can verify in real time, with no counterparty.” That clarity makes it the anchor of digital balance sheets. Even as new contenders rise, Bitcoin remains the default expression of trust in decentralized money. Ethereum: Yield, Utility, and Innovation Ethereum’s path could not be more different. Its rise in the Ether vs Bitcoin Treasuries debate stems from its flexibility. Since the network’s shift to proof-of-stake, ETH has evolved from a purely speculative asset into a productive one. Today, treasuries can stake ETH and earn between 3–5 percent annually while maintaining exposure to price movements. That simple difference changes everything. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum is not merely held, it’s used. Treasuries that allocate to ETH often deploy capital into DeFi protocols, tokenized assets, or staking validators, turning idle reserves into active positions. “Ethereum gives treasuries the ability to work their balance sheets,” said a senior analyst at a digital asset fund in Singapore. “It’s not just about price appreciation. It’s about programmable yield.” That “yield narrative” has drawn attention from both public firms and ETFs. Ethereum-linked investment products accounted for over half of institutional inflows in Q3 2025, marking a significant milestone in capital rotation. Institutional Rotation and the New Allocation Mindset The past year has seen a gradual but visible migration of treasury capital toward Ethereum. While Bitcoin ETFs remain the most liquid entry point for institutions, the demand for ETH-based exposure has accelerated. Fund flow data suggests that many corporate treasuries are adopting blended portfolios, holding Bitcoin for defensive purposes and Ethereum for active yield management. In essence, Ether vs Bitcoin Treasuries is becoming less of a competition and more of a calibration exercise. The mix depends on what each treasury values most: permanence or participation. A European fintech executive recently described it succinctly: “Bitcoin is my vault. Ethereum is my vehicle.” That sentiment captures the new institutional mood. Treasury management is no longer static; it’s dynamic, yield-aware, and blockchain-integrated. Why Yield Changes the Game The introduction of staking returns gives Ethereum an advantage that Bitcoin cannot match organically. A company that holds ETH is not just hedging against inflation, it’s earning. Treasury departments that used to park billions in near-zero-yield money markets now see Ethereum as a productive alternative. By integrating staking through regulated custodians, firms can collect steady on-chain income while keeping compliance intact. The implications are significant. That extra 3–5 percent annualized yield can lift overall reserve efficiency by 30–50 basis points on large capital pools. Over multiple quarters, this becomes a measurable performance edge. However, yield comes with risk. Validators can face slashing, network upgrades introduce uncertainty, and DeFi exposure demands technical literacy. Bitcoin’s simplicity remains its shield in this regard. As a market strategist at a U.S. bank noted, “Ethereum’s yield is attractive, but it introduces an operational layer that corporate finance desks aren’t used to managing.” Treasury Behavior Reflects Market Maturity In early 2025, a mid-cap mining company made headlines after shifting its reserves from Bitcoin to Ethereum, citing greater liquidity access and on-chain utility. Its stock price soared 3,000 percent within a week, driven by investor excitement over the shift. The case underlined how narratives drive valuation in this space. Ethereum’s integration into DeFi and tokenization makes it a natural asset for treasuries aligned with fintech, payments, or Web3 infrastructure. Meanwhile, Bitcoin continues to dominate among legacy corporates and financial institutions that prioritize security, liquidity, and auditability. As the two ecosystems mature, their respective treasury roles are becoming complementary rather than competitive. Data Snapshot: Treasury Holdings 2025 Bitcoin Treasuries: 848,000 BTC (≈4% of total supply), worth about $105 billion. Ethereum Treasuries: 12.5 million ETH (≈10% of total supply), worth around $45 billion. While Bitcoin still leads in total dollar value, Ethereum’s institutional penetration relative to its supply is deeper. That metric, percentage of circulating supply held, offers a truer reflection of conviction. In that sense, Ether vs Bitcoin Treasuries reveals an emerging equilibrium: one asset optimizing for scarcity, the other for productivity. The Strategic Divide: Store vs Stream At its core, this debate represents a philosophical divide. Bitcoin is a store of value, an anchor in a world of monetary drift. Ethereum is a stream of value, constantly circulating, compounding, and evolving. Both matter. For some treasuries, Bitcoin serves as digital ballast, a stable backstop during uncertain times. For others, Ethereum represents adaptive capital, capable of generating returns in both bull and bear cycles. As tokenized securities, on-chain bonds, and real-world assets expand, Ethereum’s programmable infrastructure becomes increasingly relevant. But as macro conditions tighten, Bitcoin’s predictability will remain a comforting constant. Ultimately, treasuries are learning what investors already know: the two assets serve different purposes, and together, they create balance. Expert Insights and Forward View Financial analysts believe the coming quarters will see a more deliberate approach to treasury diversification. Institutional allocators may adopt a 70–30 split , with Bitcoin anchoring reserves and Ethereum powering yield strategies. Citigroup recently reaffirmed its $4,500 price target for ETH and maintained a long-term neutral stance on Bitcoin, highlighting the rotational nature of institutional capital. Fidelity’s digital asset division described it well in a recent report: “ Ethereum is behaving more like an equity—yield-bearing, functional, and growth-oriented. Bitcoin remains the pure monetary asset.” The evolving Ether vs Bitcoin Treasuries balance mirrors broader market behavior: yield-seeking in expansion, consolidation in contraction. The Coexistence Era The most likely outcome is coexistence, not dominance. Treasury models in 2026 and beyond will reflect a hybrid philosophy—allocating between the permanence of Bitcoin and the productivity of Ethereum. As the global economy digitizes, these assets will not only hedge inflation but also generate income, liquidity, and programmable capital flows. Bitcoin may anchor trust; Ethereum may drive growth. Together, they define the next chapter of corporate finance in the digital age. Conclusion The Ether vs Bitcoin Treasuries debate is not a tug of war—it’s a tuning fork for institutional strategy. One frequency resonates with safety, the other with innovation. Bitcoin’s simplicity will always appeal to conservative treasuries that prize durability. Ethereum’s yield and versatility will continue to attract forward-looking firms that see blockchain not as a hedge, but as a growth engine. What was once a question of “which is better” has evolved into “which serves the purpose.” The answer, in 2025, is increasingly both. Frequently Asked Questions about Ether vs Bitcoin Treasuries 1. Why are Ether vs Bitcoin Treasuries a major topic now? Because institutions are transitioning from speculative exposure to strategic asset management, where yield, liquidity, and risk control matter. 2. Is Ethereum outperforming Bitcoin in treasury adoption? In relative terms, yes. Ethereum’s share of institutional supply is higher, though Bitcoin still leads in total dollar value. 3. How do Ethereum’s staking yields affect treasury performance? Staking provides consistent yield, improving cash efficiency while maintaining crypto exposure—something Bitcoin cannot natively offer. 4. Can both assets coexist in the same treasury? Absolutely. Many institutions now use Bitcoin for long-term stability and Ethereum for yield-based liquidity management. Glossary of Key Terms Treasury Allocation: The strategic holding of digital assets by corporations or funds to optimize balance sheet performance. Staking Yield: Reward earned for locking ETH to secure the network, typically between 3–5 percent annually. Institutional Flows: Movement of capital from professional investors into specific cryptocurrencies or funds. DeFi Integration: Use of decentralized financial tools on Ethereum to manage or grow treasury holdings.

Every major cycle brings a handful of digital assets that defy logic, flipping early conviction into exponential results. The question traders are asking now isn’t whether another bull run is coming; it’s which project will lead it.From Bitcoin ($BTC) establishing dominance to Monero ($XMR) with its trusted privacy model, veteran coins are holding their ground. Yet, under the surface, one project is quietly rewriting trading as we know it. BlockchainFX ($BFX) is merging the worlds of crypto and traditional finance into a single, blockchain-powered digital asset ecosystem. Its explosive presale progress has many analysts whispering the same phrase: “This might just be the next 100x crypto.”BlockchainFX: The All-in-One Trading Powerhouse That Could Be the Next 100x CryptoBlockchainFX is setting a new standard by fusing crypto innovation with global market access. Its upcoming super app will allow users to trade more than 500 assets, including crypto, forex, stocks, ETFs, and commodities, all in one unified dashboard. No more juggling wallets, bridges, or multiple accounts. This seamless structure makes BFX a serious contender for the next 100x crypto, as it eliminates barriers that have long limited mainstream traders from entering DeFi markets.The platform also rewards holders through daily passive earnings. Up to 70% of all trading fees are redistributed in BFX and USDT, meaning users earn simply by participating. That’s not a promise of “free money,” but a built-in incentive model that aligns with sustainable growth. Combine that with fast, secure swaps between assets like Bitcoin, gold, and ETFs, and you have a trading system designed for speed, efficiency, and financial inclusivity.Finally, the demand speaks for itself. The crypto market currently represents less than 1% of total global trading activity, a $500-trillion opportunity waiting to be unlocked. BlockchainFX bridges this gap by connecting decentralized users with global financial instruments. This combination of innovation, reward structure, and market timing positions BFX as one of the most promising candidates for the next 100x crypto title heading into 2025.BlockchainFX Presale Snapshot: 96% of Target Hit, Momentum Building FastBlockchainFX’s presale metrics underline just how rapidly the project is gaining traction. The team has already raised $9.15 million, reaching 96.24% of its $9.5 million soft cap, with over 13,650 participants worldwide. The presale price is currently $0.027, while the confirmed launch price is $0.05, representing an immediate upside for early buyers. Payment options include ETH, BNB, BTC, SOL, USDT, and even credit cards, making accessibility frictionless. Investors can also use the BLOCK30 bonus code to earn 30% extra tokens during the presale.To illustrate the math, a $2,000 investment today secures approximately 74,074 BFX tokens. When the price moves from $0.027 to $0.05, that value climbs to about $3,700. But if adoption follows projections and BFX hits $1, that same holding could soar beyond $74,000, a clear example of the asymmetry that defines the next 100x crypto opportunities. Combine this with a $500K community giveaway, real-world product progress, and audited security, and the picture becomes crystal clear: BlockchainFX isn’t just another presale, it’s a mission-ready ecosystem with momentum.Bitcoin ($BTC): Market Stability Meets Long-Term StrengthBitcoin trades at roughly $121,410.71, reflecting a modest 1.54% dip in the past 24 hours. Despite fluctuations, BTC remains the benchmark asset for every serious investor. It continues to anchor the broader market, signaling trend shifts before any other coin. Many analysts still view Bitcoin as the gateway to discovering the next 100x crypto, as its dominance often precedes capital rotation into high-growth altcoins.The bitcoin price prediction consensus stays cautiously optimistic, with most projections eyeing a $150,000–$180,000 range in the upcoming cycle. Institutional adoption, sovereign fund interest, and the ongoing supply squeeze from halving events strengthen this outlook. While not a “moonshot,” the bitcoin BTC price prediction reaffirms BTC’s role as both a hedge and a signal, the calm before the next speculative storm.Monero ($XMR): Privacy Strengthens Its Place in the MarketMonero currently trades around $334.25, slipping about 1.09% over the last day. Unlike speculative tokens, Monero’s demand stems from its unmatched privacy features, total transaction confidentiality, fungibility, and censorship resistance. In a digital world moving toward tighter surveillance, that privacy edge may prove invaluable. The Monero XMR price today acts as a gauge for the privacy sector, reflecting user sentiment toward decentralization and anonymity.Looking forward, analysts highlight that Monero’s utility could see renewed demand if regulatory pressures increase. It’s not the flashiest candidate for the next 100x crypto, but its foundational role in protecting user sovereignty gives it long-term staying power. Monero’s relevance, much like Bitcoin’s, comes from its principles, and in crypto, values have a way of compounding over time.Conclusion: The Shift From Legacy to LeverageBitcoin remains the gravitational center of digital finance, dependable, dominant, and global. Monero keeps its niche as the guardian of privacy, proving that principles still have profit potential. Yet as the market evolves, attention is drifting toward ecosystems that combine usability, yield, and cross-asset access. That’s where BlockchainFX shines.With $9.15M already raised, a near-complete soft cap, and an integrated super app set to redefine trading, BFX is showing early signs of being the next 100x crypto investors have been hunting for. It bridges markets, rewards users, and scales seamlessly, all while maintaining trust and transparency. In a cycle defined by momentum, utility, and timing, BlockchainFX stands exactly where exponential stories begin.For More InformationWebsite: https://blockchainfx.com/ X: https://x.com/BlockchainFXcomTelegram Chat: https://t.me/blockchainfx_chatThis article contains information about a cryptocurrency presale.

The sudden crash sent shockwaves through Wall Street, triggering widespread panic among investors.This was also reflected in the crypto markets, which faced similar action. The crash caused the total crypto market to drop below $4 trillion.Political trade wars and macroeconomic news released on October 10th sparked the crypto market crash. Trump’s tariffs on China led to a massive capital loss in the markets.What caused the crypto market crash? Was it Trump’s tariff?According to The Kobeissi Letter, President Trump released a statement indicating that a significant increase in tariffs was forthcoming. In a matter of three minutes, the S&P 500 lost about $700 billion in market capitalization.This was a sign that the trade wars were back. Trump also noted that the meeting with President Xi of China was unlikely.Trump’s tariff news | The Kobeissi Letter/XAs the financial markets were thrown into anarchy, investors drove U.S. Treasuries to day highs as a safe haven. Trump’s remarks on China also led to a 1.5 percent decline in the Nasdaq 100. This led to pronounced losses in crypto assets that were AI and tech-focused due to their high beta.At the same time, the offshore yuan was weakened, as Trump’s tariff proposals had affected the world’s currencies. There was panic, and traders were selling stocks in a state of uncertainty.A combination of geopolitical factors, currency instability, and the flight to safety led to the sharp decline in the market. This left Wall Street and analysts in shock, uncertain of the fallout of these linked economic shocks.How Did BTC, ETH, XRP, and Others React?From a technical perspective, the overall cryptocurrency market declined by 2.9%. It reached $3.99 trillion, indicating significant selling pressure across key players. Holders faced a market torn between macro headwinds and structural demand.For Bitcoin (BTC), the price dropped 2.49 percent to $117,801, and Ethereum (ETH) declined 5.5 percent to $4,097. This was an indication of further liquidation in futures and spot markets.Altcoins took a heavier hit in the market downturn, with Solana falling 4.19% to $209.90. XRP and Dogecoin also slid, dropping 2.67% and 4.30% respectively.This also highlighted a general weakness. DoubleZero (2Z) and World Liberty Financial (WLFI) experienced the largest crash, with declines of 16% and 14%, respectively.BTC price chart showing crash | Source: CoinMarketCapNevertheless, BNB was relatively resilient, with a 0.87% decline over 24 hours, but it was up 7.25% on a weekly basis. Market sentiment indicators shifted to neutral, with a Fear and Greed Index of 54 and an RSI of 37.65. This indicates that the market was oversold.Analysts attribute the sudden market drop to profit-taking and a decline in liquidity. Uncertainty around ETF developments added to investor caution.Overleveraged Positions To Be Cleared!Another reason could be the urge to clear overleveraged positions from the market. Since the last quarter of the year was bullish, this could be a common tendency to clear out liquidity.Perpetual futures for Bitcoin were at highs, and it was common for this leverage to be reduced. This meant that longs were trapped but were resisting liquidations.BTC futures open interest | Source: GlassnodeIn conclusion, the market was majorly affected by the trade war and shift of capital to treasuries as a haven. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP all dropped to key levels, while Binance Coin (BNB) stayed above $1200.lennox gitongaLennox is a professional financial market analyst who’s enthusiastic about blockchain, cryptos, and web3.

The announcement spooked investors and fanned fears over protracted trade tensions between the United States and China. In a matter of hours, Bitcoin crashed greater than 8% and lost billions as its market cap crumbled. This led to the broader crypto market to sell off alongside Bitcoin. The trajectory of the cryptocurrency market illustrates anew how closely digital assets now align with important signals from global economies and politics.Bitcoin drops sharply after Trump pledge to hit all Chinese imports with 100% tariffs. pic.twitter.com/c5dE6LDNez— Current Report (@Currentreport1) October 11, 2025 How Trump’s Tariff Plan Sparked Panic in CryptoMarkets were caught off guard when Trump’s statement spread across social media, promising to “end China’s unfair trade advantage” by imposing maximum tariffs. The proposed plan suggested a full embrace of the aggressive protectionist policies of recent history. Market participants swiftly perceived this as an escalation of economic hostilities. They had quickly drew down on economically sensitive high-risk assets and moved to instruments such as U.S. Treasury securities. The collapse of the price of Bitcoin was a function of the policy, but it also revealed a pervasive market anxiety that rising tariffs might weaken trade, disrupt tech supply chains, and introduce more liquidity risks into the financial system.Leverage and Liquidations Amplified the DownturnThe selloff intensified as leveraged traders faced mass liquidations. Exchanges recorded millions in forced closures of long positions, accelerating the downward spiral. The crypto market’s structure, highly leveraged and driven by derivatives, made it particularly vulnerable to this shock. Once Bitcoin broke key technical levels, automated sell orders flooded the market. The crypto market then experienced one of its sharpest intraday declines in recent months, with Ethereum, Solana, and several other altcoins following Bitcoin’s trajectory.Trade War Fears Resurface in Global MarketsTrump’s tariff plan evoked memories from the 2018-19 trade war and its aftermath on global manufacturing and capital flows. The proposed tariffs of 100% would impact nearly all Chinese goods ranging from electronics, machinery, and raw materials used in crypto mining. There were concerns from market that the trade war would heighten supply chain issues in the technology sector. Concerns led to selling pressure associated as traders unwind risk positions. The correlation between crypto and macroeconomic sentiment became clear once again, when trade fears rise, risk assets fall.Bitcoin Crash Reflects Broader Market RepricingThe Bitcoin crash, in addition to how it caused some reflexive liquidations, tells a bigger story: the markets are repricing risk. As geopolitical uncertainty rises, investors seek safety and have moved to stability in gold, bonds, and the U.S. dollar. Like risk assets, Bitcoin, which was once thought to be an inflation hedge, behaved like a risk asset this time. This behavior change highlights that crypto is now responding heavily to real world policy developments. It is no longer insulated from those policy developments. Analysts suggest that the volatility may stay extended as traders reassess their willingness to have exposure to speculative assets based around renewed trade tensions.Final ThoughtsThe decline of Bitcoin ensuing Trump’s 100% tariffs is a harsh reminder that digital assets are not immune. Each significant political and economic happening will have implications for the crypto ecosystem. As trade tensions continue to increase, investors will need to be alert. They should change their investment style, and prepare for stable or unstable levels of volatility. The connection between the policy of the world and crypto returns has never been more pervasive, and in today’s playing field, headlines can move prices as quickly as innovation can.The post Bitcoin Crashes After Trump’s 100% Tariff Pledge on Imports appeared first on Coinfomania.",2025-10-11 09:23:03,UTC,,,coinfomania,Coinfomania,5766846,https://coinfomania.com,https://n.bytvi.com/crypto/coinfomania.jpg,english,['BTC'],negative,"{'positive': 0.08, 'neutral': 0.16, 'negative': 99.77}","['economy', 'government']",False

US President Trump’s surprise announcement of a 100% tariff on Chinese imports starting November 1, plus some new rules on critical software exports.Investors freaked out, worried a full-blown trade war was back on, and all those leveraged crypto positions started getting liquidated left and right.And it wasn’t just Bitcoin as Ethereum, Solana, and other big altcoins got dragged down too as traders scrambled to get out of risky bets.Bitcoin crash: Crypto meltdown follows Trump’s tariff shockAfter Trump dropped the tariff bombshell, Bitcoin went into freefall.It had been cruising above $120,000 earlier in October but slid all the way down to around $102,000 on major exchanges like Binance, its lowest point since mid-2025.In just 24 hours, more than $19 billion in leveraged crypto positions got wiped out, taking down about 1.6 million traders in one of the biggest single-day liquidation events the crypto world has ever seen.According to data from Coinglass, a whopping $16.8 billion of that came from long positions, a clear sign that overleveraged investors were completely blindsided.Ethereum tanked over 16%, Solana slipped under $190, and some smaller tokens lost nearly half their value.The entire crypto market shed close to $500 billion, dropping from $4.27 trillion to around $3.84 trillion as panic selling kicked in.Social media and trading platforms lit up with chaos as automated liquidation systems kicked into overdrive, triggering even more forced sales and pushing prices down even further.Even stablecoins weren’t spared as USDe briefly lost its dollar peg during the chaos, adding to the panic.The whole episode was a harsh reminder of just how sensitive the crypto market still is to big macro and geopolitical shocks, especially with so much money tied up in leveraged trades.What analysts sayAccording to market experts, Trump’s tariff shock was really just the spark that set off a much bigger wave of risk-off sentiment across global markets.As per Cryptopolitan, a Blockscope Research analyst said the 100% China tariff “instantly priced in global recession fears,” pushing investors to dump risky assets, Bitcoin included.Several analysts even compared the crash to past black swan events, calling it one of the most brutal shakeouts in recent years.Still, not everyone’s panicking. An analyst from BitMEX pointed out that while Bitcoin’s drop was steep, its long-term fundamentals haven’t changed, and the crash had created rare buying opportunities.EconSphere Advisors economist added another layer of concern, he warned that the new tariffs and export controls could seriously mess with global supply chains, especially in areas like semiconductors and AI.That, he said, could put even more pressure on already fragile risk markets if the trade fight keeps escalating.The post Bitcoin crashes below $110K as Trump's 100% tariff on China triggers $19B sell-off appeared first on Invezz",2025-10-11 09:15:56,UTC,https://invezz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20250922_162100_ry9iY.png,,invezz,Invezz,20604,https://invezz.com,https://n.bytvi.com/crypto/invezz.png,english,['BTC'],negative,"{'positive': 0.060000000000000005, 'neutral': 0.13, 'negative': 99.82}",['economy'],False

BTC price action fails to stage a rebound from multi-week lows, with $100,000 getting closer. Crypto is beginning a “cleanse” of bull-market euphoria, a trader says. Bitcoin ( BTC ) pressured $110,000 support on Saturday as the dust settled on a record $20 billion liquidation event. Trader sees start of “crypto cleanse” Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD struggling to rebound after falling to three-week lows on Bitstamp. Fresh market nerves over the US-China trade war punished risk assets across the board. The S&P 500 closed down 2.7% Friday, while gold emerged as a rare beneficiary, heading back above $4,000 per ounce. Amid the crypto carnage, Bitcoin’s relative strength index ( RSI ) became deeply “oversold.” Four-hour RSI was at levels not seen since the start of the trade war debacle in February. “Seeing a lot of short positioning rolling off here aggregately,” trader Skew wrote in ongoing coverage on X. $BTC Here's Binance & Coinbase Spot 6K Price slip on binance spot vs coinbase spot today, although binance did 81.9K BTC in Volume on that 4H candle pic.twitter.com/nhFb79cFGi Skew added that even major crypto exchanges had struggled during the downside volatility.

Related: Bitcoin may get ‘dragged around a bit’ amid Trump tariff fears: Exec Data from CoinGlass indicates that 24-hour liquidations reached nearly $20 billion, with long positions comprising the vast majority. “The actual total is likely much higher — Binance only reports one liquidation order per second,” CoinGlass said on X about the figures. Exchange order-book liquidity showed a severe imbalance between bids and asks — resistance was stacked around $120,000, while little support was in place to prevent a fresh dive toward the $100,000 mark.

En un informe publicado, el banco alemán destaca dinámicas comunes entre ambos activos, tradicionalmente opuestos. Este análisis cuestiona el lugar que podría ocupar Bitcoin en las reservas oficiales a medio plazo. El oro recupera un papel central en las estrategias de los bancos centrales Mientras el oro y Bitcoin alcanzan máximos , Deutsche Bank revela en su último informe titulado «Gold’s reign, Bitcoin’s rise» que la participación del metal precioso en las reservas oficiales de los bancos centrales alcanzó el 24 % en el segundo trimestre de este año, su nivel más alto desde los años 1990. Este nivel refleja un cambio estratégico importante en la gestión de los activos de reserva. Los analistas del banco señalan que la demanda oficial de oro se integra ahora a un ritmo « dos veces superior al promedio del período 2011–2021 ». Más que un simple rebote coyuntural, esta dinámica se percibe como un retorno del oro al centro de las lógicas de soberanía financiera. El informe precisa que « la acumulación renovada de oro marca un giro importante en las finanzas mundiales, evocando el comportamiento observado durante gran parte del siglo XX ». Este resurgimiento del oro ocurre justo cuando el metal amarillo acaba de superar, en valor real, sus máximos históricos alcanzados en 1980, según ajustes por inflación. Deutsche Bank identifica varios factores que explican esta evolución tardía y la importancia del momento actual : Décadas de ventas masivas por parte de los bancos centrales, especialmente en los años 1990 y 2000, que contribuyeron a mantener los precios bajo presión ; Las obligaciones de cesiones institucionales, especialmente en algunos fondos bajo restricciones regulatorias ; El efecto duradero de la transición a la era de las monedas fiat, desde el abandono del patrón oro a finales de los años 1970 ; La pérdida del papel formal del oro como activo de referencia, oficializada en 1979 cuando el FMI prohibió a los Estados miembros ligar su moneda al oro ; El retorno progresivo de la desconfianza hacia las monedas fiduciarias, acentuado por la multiplicación de crisis monetarias y políticas de expansión monetaria no convencionales. En resumen, el oro parece retomar una función que no tenía oficialmente desde hace más de cuarenta años. Un desarrollo que, según Deutsche Bank, abre la puerta a nuevas lecturas sobre la naturaleza de los activos de reserva, incluidos los digitales. Bitcoin : una trayectoria que interpelará a las instituciones En el mismo informe, Marion Laboure, macroestratega en Deutsche Bank, traza un paralelo explícito entre las dinámicas del oro y las de Bitcoin. Ella señala que ambos activos presentan características comunes importantes: « baja correlación con los activos tradicionales, una volatilidad históricamente alta aunque en fuerte descenso para Bitcoin, y un papel de refugio en épocas de inestabilidad ». Según ella, estas similitudes podrían abrir el camino a una adopción institucional más amplia, incluso a una integración en los balances de los bancos centrales. No obstante, Laboure no minimiza los frenos que persisten. Reconoce que Bitcoin sigue siendo un activo « respaldado por nada », lo que constituye un obstáculo ideológico para muchas instituciones. A esto se suman limitaciones técnicas y económicas, tales como « uso aún restringido, percepción de alto riesgo, naturaleza especulativa, vulnerabilidades en ciberseguridad y restricciones de liquidez ». A pesar de estas reservas, Deutsche Bank considera plausible que Bitcoin y el oro « puedan figurar ambos en los balances de los bancos centrales para 2030 ». Si esta hipótesis se materializara, significaría una legitimación institucional de Bitcoin, pero también una redefinición de los activos de reserva en un mundo cada vez más multipolar. El creciente interés de algunos Estados por la inclusión de BTC en sus reservas estratégicas, como lo demuestra la reciente cumbre para avanzar el proyecto en Estados Unidos , aunque marginal por ahora, podría acelerar esta dinámica.",2025-10-11 09:10:00,UTC,https://www.cointribune.com/app/uploads/2025/10/Bitcoin-Deutsche-Bank.png,,cointribune,Cointribune,80640,https://www.cointribune.com/es,https://n.bytvi.com/crypto/cointribune.jpg,spanish,['BTC'],neutral,"{'positive': 4.99, 'neutral': 89.7, 'negative': 5.31}",['economy'],False

What caused Bitcoin’s 17% price drop and $19.29B in liquidations? Bitcoin price drop was driven by a rapid reversal from new highs, triggering cascading sell orders and a long squeeze. Sharp loss of short-term support near $119,979 pushed BTC from $122,500 to $101,500, forcing $19.29 billion in liquidations and impacting 1.65 million trader accounts. The liquidation wave began after BTC recorded a new all-time high near $124,545 and then broke below short-term resistance. Data reported by market trackers and traders shows long positions made up approximately $16.8 billion of the $19.29 billion total. Bitcoin saw about $5.36 billion liquidated, Ethereum $4.42 billion, Solana $2.00 billion and XRP $706 million. Bitcoin drops 17% from $122,500 to $101,500, wiping out $19.29B in leveraged positions as traders face massive liquidations. Bitcoin fell close to 17% within a span of a few hours, from $122,500 to $101,500, and this caused a cascade of liquidations across the board and substantially greater volatility for all of the top cryptocurrencies. After hitting roughly $124,545, BTC encountered heavy profit-taking and a loss of short-term support at $119,979. That break activated stop-losses and margin calls, which snowballed into a classic long squeeze. Technical indicators showed sellers overwhelming bids, producing rapid downside pressure before buyers stepped in around $113,000 and later near the $108,000 support zone. The cryptocurrency market experienced extreme sell pressure as the Bitcoin price made a steep pullback following recording a new all-time high at $124,545. The same pullback erased much of the recent gains in a jaw-dropping rally phase and pushed BTC towards a crucial support level of about $108,000. Crypto Patel describes that the market declined from $122,500 to $101,500 within hours, which reveals how unpredictable the market could be. Technical charts show that Bitcoin lost the short-term resistance level of $119,979, causing cascading sell orders. The daily candle shows a bit of a bounce around $113,000, indicating that buyers are attempting to return. Yet recovery momentum will be questionable unless Bitcoin gets back above the $117,000–$120,000 range. If price action does not maintain above key support areas, trends will suggest the market will try and test the zone of $100,000–102,000. If the price continues to stay above $119,000, there is a chance we can view the broader bullish trend, which is still intact in the larger time frames. The sudden decline triggered a record wave of liquidations, totaling $19.29 billion in the past 24 hours. Data shared by market trackers shows that over 1.65 million traders were liquidated, marking one of the largest events in recent history. Long positions accounted for $16.8 billion of the total, signaling an extensive long squeeze as prices fell rapidly. Bitcoin traders experienced the biggest amount of liquidations, worth about approximately $5.36 billion. Ethereum came thereafter at about $4.42 billion. Solana was at $2.00 billion, and XRP followed with $706 million in liquidations. The biggest single liquidation was for $203.36 million and happened on Hyperliquid on the ETH-USDT pair. This forced closure event is a manifestation of excessive leverage in the market, as traders had positioned themselves aggressively for continued upside. Once long positions quickly unwound, it caused the downside move to expand temporarily as part of a short-term correction. Since its sharp drop, Bitcoin has been holding between a good support of approximately at $108,000 and a resistance of approximately at $120,000. Price action suggests traders are assessing direction amid lower liquidity in the markets. A breakdown below support would likely extend correction toward the $100,000 area, while a move above resistance would likely signal renewed bullish interest. While the latest liquidation flush may have been an opportunity to reset some over-leveraged positions and may align with a healthier structure for prospective moves, general market participant sentiment continues to be cautious, while longer-term fundamentals look relatively stable as traders await confirmation of recovery and risk appetite. The post-liquidation flush is indicative of the volatility of price discovery at elevated levels, and the wider trading community is observing both key zones and how the market holds up post one of the largest liquidation events since 2021. Frequently Asked Questions Approximately 1.65 million traders were liquidated during the event, contributing to a cumulative $19.29 billion in forced closures across BTC, ETH and other major tokens. Key support is between $100,000–$108,000, while immediate resistance sits around $117,000–$120,000. Holding above $119,000 would favor the broader bullish trend; failure may prompt tests of the $100,000 zone. Long liquidations dominated the event, accounting for about $16.8 billion of the $19.29 billion total, indicating a significant long squeeze as the market reversed sharply from highs. Key Takeaways The Bitcoin price drop and resulting liquidation wave underscore how concentrated leverage can amplify volatility. Traders and institutions will watch the $108,000–$120,000 band closely for signs of a sustainable recovery. For now, market participants should manage risk, monitor liquidity, and follow official exchange data and analytics providers for updates.

In a published report, the German bank highlights common dynamics between the two traditionally opposed assets. This analysis questions the place that bitcoin could hold in official reserves in the medium term. Gold regains a central role in central banks’ strategies While gold and bitcoin reach record highs , Deutsche Bank reveals in its latest report “Gold’s reign, Bitcoin’s rise” that the share of the precious metal in official central bank reserves reached 24 % in the second quarter of this year, its highest level since the 1990s. This level reflects a major strategic shift in reserve asset management. The bank’s analysts note that official gold demand is now growing at a rate “ twice the average for the 2011–2021 period “. More than just a cyclical rebound, this dynamic is seen as a return of gold to the heart of financial sovereignty logics. The report specifies that “ the renewed accumulation of gold marks a major turning point in global finance, evoking behavior observed during much of the 20th century “. This resurgence of gold occurs even as the yellow metal has just surpassed, in real terms, its highest historical peaks reached in 1980, according to inflation adjustments. Deutsche Bank identifies several factors explaining this late evolution and the importance of the current moment : Decades of massive sales by central banks, notably in the 1990s and 2000s, which had helped keep prices under pressure ; Institutional disposal obligations, notably for certain funds under regulatory constraints ; The lasting effect of the transition to the fiat currency era, since the abandonment of the gold standard in the late 1970s ; The loss of the formal role of gold as a reference asset, established in 1979 when the IMF banned member states from tying their currency to gold ; The gradual return of distrust towards fiat currencies, amplified by multiple monetary crises and unconventional monetary expansion policies. In sum, gold seems to be reclaiming a function it had not officially held for over forty years. An evolution which, according to Deutsche Bank, opens the way to new interpretations of reserve assets, including digital ones. Bitcoin : a trajectory that catches the attention of institutions In the same report, Marion Laboure, macro-strategist at Deutsche Bank, draws an explicit parallel between the dynamics of gold and those of Bitcoin. She notes that these two assets share major common characteristics : “ a low correlation with traditional assets, historically high volatility, although sharply decreasing for Bitcoin, and a role as a safe haven during times of instability “. According to her, these similarities could pave the way for wider institutional adoption, possibly even integration into central banks’ balance sheets. However, Laboure does not downplay the remaining obstacles. She acknowledges that bitcoin remains an asset “ backed by nothing “, which represents an ideological hurdle for many institutions. Added to this are technical and economic limitations, such as “ limited use, perceived high risk, speculative nature, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and liquidity constraints “. Despite these reservations, Deutsche Bank considers it plausible that bitcoin and gold “ could both appear in central banks’ balance sheets by 2030 “. If this hypothesis materializes, it would signify institutional legitimization of bitcoin, but also a redefinition of reserve assets in an increasingly multipolar world. The growing interest of some states in including BTC in their strategic reserves, as evidenced by the recent summit meeting to advance the project in the United States , although marginal for now, could accelerate this dynamic.",2025-10-11 09:05:34,UTC,https://www.cointribune.com/app/uploads/2025/10/Bitcoin-Deutsche-Bank.png,,cointribuneen,Cointribuneen,94316,https://www.cointribune.com/en,https://n.bytvi.com/crypto/cointribuneen.jpg,english,['BTC'],positive,"{'positive': 94.9, 'neutral': 4.71, 'negative': 0.39}",['economy'],False

This sharp BTC sell-off forced a large long squeeze [...]","Bitcoin price drop of ~17% from $122,500 to $101,500 triggered a $19.29B liquidation wave that closed positions for 1.65 million traders. This sharp BTC sell-off forced a large long squeeze and left the market consolidating between $108,000 and $120,000 as participants await direction. Bitcoin plunged ~17% in hours, erasing recent gains and testing key support at $108,000. Over 1.65 million traders were liquidated, totaling $19.29 billion in forced closures across major cryptocurrencies. Long positions accounted for roughly $16.8 billion; Bitcoin and Ethereum led the liquidation impact. Bitcoin price drop wipes out $19.29B in leveraged positions; learn how the 17% BTC plunge triggered 1.65M liquidations and what support levels traders watch. What caused Bitcoin’s 17% price drop and $19.29B in liquidations? Bitcoin price drop was driven by a rapid reversal from new highs, triggering cascading sell orders and a long squeeze. Sharp loss of short-term support near $119,979 pushed BTC from $122,500 to $101,500, forcing $19.29 billion in liquidations and impacting 1.65 million trader accounts. How did the liquidation wave unfold and which assets were hit hardest? The liquidation wave began after BTC recorded a new all-time high near $124,545 and then broke below short-term resistance. Data reported by market trackers and traders shows long positions made up approximately $16.8 billion of the $19.29 billion total. Bitcoin saw about $5.36 billion liquidated, Ethereum $4.42 billion, Solana $2.00 billion and XRP $706 million. Bitcoin drops 17% from $122,500 to $101,500, wiping out $19.29B in leveraged positions as traders face massive liquidations. The price of Bitcoin dropped in a matter of hours from $122,500 to $101,500, removing recent gains and testing the significant support zone around $108,000. Over 1.65 million traders were liquidated, corresponding to a total loss of $19.29 billion, as Bitcoin and Ethereum drove the liquidation wave. The market has been consolidating within the range of $108,000-$120,000, waiting to determine whether a breakout will occur or a further slump of the price. Bitcoin fell close to 17% within a span of a few hours, from $122,500 to $101,500, and this caused a cascade of liquidations across the board and substantially greater volatility for all of the top cryptocurrencies. Why did BTC reverse so sharply after a new all-time high? After hitting roughly $124,545, BTC encountered heavy profit-taking and a loss of short-term support at $119,979. That break activated stop-losses and margin calls, which snowballed into a classic long squeeze. Technical indicators showed sellers overwhelming bids, producing rapid downside pressure before buyers stepped in around $113,000 and later near the $108,000 support zone. Bitcoin Faces Sharp Reversal After Reaching New All-Time High The cryptocurrency market experienced extreme sell pressure as the Bitcoin price made a steep pullback following recording a new all-time high at $124,545. The same pullback erased much of the recent gains in a jaw-dropping rally phase and pushed BTC towards a crucial support level of about $108,000. Crypto Patel describes that the market declined from $122,500 to $101,500 within hours, which reveals how unpredictable the market could be. Technical charts show that Bitcoin lost the short-term resistance level of $119,979, causing cascading sell orders. The daily candle shows a bit of a bounce around $113,000, indicating that buyers are attempting to return. Yet recovery momentum will be questionable unless Bitcoin gets back above the $117,000–$120,000 range. If price action does not maintain above key support areas, trends will suggest the market will try and test the zone of $100,000–102,000. If the price continues to stay above $119,000, there is a chance we can view the broader bullish trend, which is still intact in the larger time frames. $19.29 Billion in Liquidations Sweep Across the Market The sudden decline triggered a record wave of liquidations, totaling $19.29 billion in the past 24 hours. Data shared by market trackers shows that over 1.65 million traders were liquidated, marking one of the largest events in recent history. Long positions accounted for $16.8 billion of the total, signaling an extensive long squeeze as prices fell rapidly.

Market Awaits Stability as Bitcoin Consolidates Near Support Since its sharp drop, Bitcoin has been holding between a good support of approximately at $108,000 and a resistance of approximately at $120,000. Price action suggests traders are assessing direction amid lower liquidity in the markets. A breakdown below support would likely extend correction toward the $100,000 area, while a move above resistance would likely signal renewed bullish interest.

Frequently Asked Questions How many traders were liquidated during the Bitcoin sell-off? Approximately 1.65 million traders were liquidated during the event, contributing to a cumulative $19.29 billion in forced closures across BTC, ETH and other major tokens. What support and resistance levels matter after the drop? Key support is between $100,000–$108,000, while immediate resistance sits around $117,000–$120,000. Holding above $119,000 would favor the broader bullish trend; failure may prompt tests of the $100,000 zone. Was this driven by long or short liquidations? Long liquidations dominated the event, accounting for about $16.8 billion of the $19.29 billion total, indicating a significant long squeeze as the market reversed sharply from highs. Key Takeaways Rapid BTC reversal : A 17% drop erased recent gains and exposed short-term support weaknesses. Massive liquidations : $19.29B total; ~1.65M traders affected, with longs making up most losses. Watch support zones : $108,000 and $100,000 are critical; recovery requires reclaiming $117,000–$120,000. Conclusion The Bitcoin price drop and resulting liquidation wave underscore how concentrated leverage can amplify volatility.

Trump’s transformation from a vocal crypto skeptic to one of Bitcoin’s largest holders might reshape both market sentiment and political narratives around digital assets. In the timespan of six months, starting from his election in November last year, Bitcoin’s value increased approximately 60%. If Trump continues to push pro-crypto policies like the establishment of the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and friendlier tax and regulatory frameworks, this may make big institutions in the country adopt crypto much faster.

Shoppers simply scan a QR code at checkout, authorize the transaction, and the merchant receives funds instantly in South African rand, removing the need for manual conversion or third-party processing.Behind the scenes, MoneyBadger’s infrastructure bridges traditional payment systems with crypto rails, turning any smartphone wallet into a powerful digital payment tool. The integration could mark the beginning of Bitcoin’s transition from investment asset to everyday currency in South Africa.MoneyBadger CEO Carel van Wyk described the move as a shift from “hodling” to genuine financial use. “People are realizing that Bitcoin isn’t just a store of value – it’s money that works,” he said. “True adoption depends on spending, not speculation.”For merchants, the transition is seamless. Scan to Pay, already the country’s dominant QR payment platform, now supports crypto payments without requiring additional hardware or software updates. “We’ve made it effortless for users to spend their crypto while merchants receive instant fiat,” explained Theo Koma, product head at Scan to Pay.The partnership also links Luno’s 30,000 existing merchants to Scan to Pay’s network, expanding crypto acceptance to household brands like Shoprite, Checkers, Makro, and Vodacom.With South Africa’s fintech ecosystem growing rapidly, this collaboration positions the country as one of the world’s most crypto-forward retail markets.

La Deutsche Bank identifie plusieurs facteurs expliquant cette évolution tardive et l’importance du moment actuel : Des décennies de ventes massives par les banques centrales, notamment dans les années 1990 et 2000, qui avaient contribué à maintenir les prix sous pression ; Les obligations de cessions institutionnelles, notamment chez certains fonds sous contrainte réglementaire ; L’effet durable du passage à l’ère des monnaies fiat, depuis l’abandon de l’étalon-or à la fin des années 1970 ; La perte du rôle formel de l’or comme actif de référence, actée en 1979 lorsque le FMI a interdit aux États membres de lier leur devise à l’or ; Le retour progressif de la défiance vis-à-vis des monnaies fiduciaires, accentué par la multiplication des crises monétaires et des politiques d’expansion monétaire non conventionnelles. En somme, l’or semble reprendre une fonction qu’il n’avait plus officiellement depuis plus de quarante ans. Une évolution qui, selon la Deutsche Bank, ouvre la voie à de nouvelles lectures sur la nature des actifs de réserve, y compris numériques. Le Bitcoin : une trajectoire qui interpelle les institutions Dans le même rapport, Marion Laboure, macro-stratégiste chez Deutsche Bank, dresse un parallèle explicite entre les dynamiques de l’or et celles du Bitcoin. Elle note que ces deux actifs présentent des caractéristiques communes majeures : « une faible corrélation avec les actifs traditionnels, une volatilité historiquement élevée, bien qu’en nette baisse pour le Bitcoin, et un rôle de valeur refuge en période d’instabilité ». Selon elle, ces similitudes pourraient ouvrir la voie à une adoption institutionnelle plus large, voire à une intégration dans les bilans des banques centrales. Pour autant, Laboure ne minimise pas les freins qui subsistent. Elle reconnaît que le bitcoin reste un actif « adossé à rien », ce qui constitue un obstacle idéologique pour de nombreuses institutions. À cela s’ajoutent des limitations techniques et économiques, telles que « l’usage encore restreint, la perception de risque élevé, la nature spéculative, les vulnérabilités cybersécuritaires et les contraintes de liquidité ». Malgré ces réserves, la Deutsche Bank estime plausible que le bitcoin et l’or « puissent tous deux figurer dans les bilans des banques centrales d’ici 2030 » . Si cette hypothèse venait à se concrétiser, elle signifierait une légitimation institutionnelle du bitcoin, mais aussi une redéfinition des actifs de réserve dans un monde de plus en plus multipolaire. L’intérêt croissant de certains États pour l’inclusion de BTC dans leurs réserves stratégiques comme en témoigne la récente réunion au sommet pour faire avancer le projet aux États-Unis , bien que marginal pour l’instant, pourrait accélérer cette dynamique.",2025-10-11 09:00:00,UTC,https://www.cointribune.com/app/uploads/2025/10/Bitcoin-Deutsche-Bank.png,,cointribune,Cointribune,80640,https://www.cointribune.com/es,https://n.bytvi.com/crypto/cointribune.jpg,french,['BTC'],neutral,"{'positive': 22.83, 'neutral': 61.52, 'negative': 15.65}",['general'],False

In short, these AI giants are all funding each other, keeping the money spinning inside the same small circle. As AMD joins it, analysts are calling this self-reinforcing investment loop a “massive red flag.” Parallels can be drawn to the dot-com bubble when Cisco funded gear purchases, effectively fueling demand for its own networking infrastructure, and inflating valuations until the bubble burst. “People often forget that the Dotcom bubble caused an 80% Nasdaq crash,” The Great Martis said, adding: “AI, crypto, quantum, nuclear” bubble warning Trader and educator Adam Khoo warns that the current AI and crypto boom may turn Bitcoin into one of the biggest losers when it ends. Related: Crypto treasury companies pose a similar risk to the 2000s dotcom bust Khoo recalls that during the 2000–2002 crash, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway gained 80% by avoiding the tech sector entirely and holding profitable companies such as Coca-Cola, American Express and Moody’s. “Money ran out of tech and flowed into all the non-tech,” Khoo says, adding: Buffett neither holds Nvidia nor AMD shares, and not “rat poison squared” BTC. He is instead sitting on a record $350 billion cash pile, echoing Berkshire’s cautious stance ahead of the tech bubble burst in 2000.

Over the past five years, Bitcoin has maintained its status as a safe-haven asset, validating its role as “digital gold.” Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, reinforced this view, calling Bitcoin “the global monetary system”, a revolutionary concept that she believes sets it apart from every other crypto project. Wood emphasized that Bitcoin’s security record remains unmatched: the Layer-1 blockchain has never been hacked, a distinction not all networks can claim. Ark Invest, an early Bitcoin bull since 2017, continues to back the asset through both direct exposure and holdings in Bitcoin-linked companies such as MicroStrategy (MSTR). The firm’s long-term forecast remains highly optimistic, with a price target of $2.4 million per BTC by 2030. In the short term, Bitcoin’s technical structure supports this bullish stance. The 20-day (green) and 50-day (blue) EMAs show a steep upward slope, confirming strong buying momentum during dips. The $117,000–$115,000 support zone, where these EMAs converge, serves as a critical level for maintaining the bullish structure. Meanwhile, the 100-day EMA (orange), currently near $113,000, provides medium-term support. This level Bitcoin reclaimed in late September, triggering its latest upward surge. Despite occasional volatility, both Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to exhibit strong uptrends. Ethereum’s fundamental upgrades and the growing treasury accumulation narrative could fuel a move toward $10,000, representing a 100% surge from current levels. Bitcoin, on the other hand, retains its dominance as the market’s anchor asset and institutional favorite.

7e5c349d0c0c154130ddf1b817d02eda,Why Gold is Beating Bitcoin: Trends & Insights,https://icodesk.io/crypto/why-gold-is-beating-bitcoin-trends-insights,,,,"Throughout 2025, gold’s rally has surprised many observers. While Bitcoin and other digital assets have drawn headlines for their volatility and innovation, gold has quietly outpaced them across several key metrics — a performance shift that is reshaping how investors view traditional vs. digital stores of value. From surging central bank demand and macro instability to regulatory headwinds in crypto, the yellow metal is flexing strength in areas where Bitcoin appears vulnerable. Below, we dive into why gold is beating bitcoin , what it means for asset allocation, and whether this advantage is likely to persist. 1. A Strong Macro and Safe-Haven Tailwind Market stress, geopolitical uncertainty, and inflation fears tend to push capital toward assets with perceived stability. In 2025, that pattern has favored gold in a big way: Gold has crossed $4,000 per ounce for the first time, posting sharp gains year-to-date. Unlike Bitcoin, gold is a well-understood and time-tested safe-haven instrument. In times of fear or uncertainty, investors often default to it. Central banks are aggressively increasing gold reserves. This institutional demand offers a structural backbone to the rally. Real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates have been under pressure, reducing the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like gold. Bitcoin has benefited from some of the same macro forces — weak dollar, inflation hedging narratives, institutional flows — but gold’s longer history as a safety anchor gives it a credibility edge during turbulence. 2. Scale, Liquidity & Market Depth One structural advantage gold possesses is sheer scale and liquidity: The gold market (including physical, futures, ETFs) is deeply established, with vast global capital flows. Bitcoin, while increasingly liquid, is still smaller in overall market cap and more sensitive to flows, regulatory changes, and sentiment shifts. Gold can absorb large purchases with less slippage; Bitcoin can spasm under large orders or margin/liquidation cascades. Because gold’s market infrastructure is mature — with major exchanges, derivatives markets, and institutional access — it has fewer friction points when capital rotates in or out. 3. Regulatory Risk & Crypto Headwinds Bitcoin’s upside is often entangled with regulatory uncertainty and structural risks: Governments and regulators worldwide are still grappling with how to classify, tax, or regulate crypto. Sudden crackdowns, bans, or unfavorable rulings can spook markets. Crypto infrastructure — exchanges, wallets, Layer-2 systems — faces hacking, software bugs, and governance vulnerabilities. Some institutional investors may hesitate to fully commit to crypto due to custody, compliance, or regulatory transparency issues. Gold, by contrast, is a known quantity in regulation, taxation, and institutional frameworks . It doesn’t face periodic existential risk from new laws or bans. 4. Momentum, Sentiment & Rotation Markets tend to favor what’s already working — momentum begets further momentum: As gold started outperforming, more investors shifted capital into it, reinforcing the trend. Some capital that might have looked at Bitcoin is being diverted to gold, especially from cautious or risk-averse investors. The narrative shift matters: gold is once again being framed not just as relic or inflation hedge, but as a modern anchor in uncertain times. Crypto markets are prone to speculative rotations — one day altcoins lead, the next, a sector pullback. Gold’s more stable upward trajectory attracts “safe profit” capital. In short: once gold’s outperformance becomes a visible trend, the migration of capital can amplify its lead over more volatile alternatives. 5. Risks & What Could Turn the Tables Gold’s current edge is not guaranteed to last indefinitely. Some counterpoints and risks: Overextension & technical pullbacks: Gold’s rapid gains raise the risk of corrections or consolidation, especially if momentum fades. Bitcoin’s asymmetric upside: While more volatile, Bitcoin still carries the potential for far larger percentage moves upward in bull phases. Technological breakthroughs or policy clarity in crypto could reignite interest and shift capital back. Macro pivots: If rates rise aggressively or inflation is tamed quickly, assets like Bitcoin might outperform due to higher growth exposure. Sentiment reversal: If risk appetite returns strongly, capital may rotate back into growth / innovation assets like crypto. 6. What This Means for Investors Diversification matters: Gold’s current lead argues for including precious metals alongside crypto in balanced portfolios. Mind allocation timing: Avoid committing heavily to Bitcoin only because it’s “the future”— but also avoid dismissing its long-term potential. Monitor catalysts: Regulatory developments, macro policy shifts, central bank buying or selling, and crypto network updates will all influence direction. Scale your exposure: Allocate in tiers — base “anchor” positions (gold, stable assets) and satellite bets (digital assets, altcoins) with proper risk controls. Use pullbacks as opportunities: If gold corrects, or if crypto weakens, that might offer re-entry points. Conclusion Gold is currently outperforming Bitcoin in 2025 for a confluence of reasons: its historical safe-haven status, deep liquidity and scale, structural regulatory advantages, and growing investor momentum. While Bitcoin still carries appeal, especially for high upside in growth cycles, gold is enjoying the upper hand in this phase. Rather than viewing this as a binary matchup, the smarter strategy may lie in embracing both, allocating to each in balance with risk tolerance and long-term conviction.",2025-10-11 08:30:00,UTC,https://media.assettype.com/icodesk%2F2025-10-10%2F82nx0vkk%2FWhy-Gold-is-Beating-Bitcoin-Trends-Insights.jpg?ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&enlarge=true&mode=crop&ogImage=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100&w=1200,,icodesk,Icodesk Io,457287,https://icodesk.io,https://n.bytvi.com/crypto/icodesk.jpg,english,['BTC'],positive,"{'positive': 58.93, 'neutral': 35.5, 'negative': 5.57}",['general'],False

At the same time, the 10-year Treasury yield held firm near 4.65%, indicating tight liquidity conditions and limited appetite for high-risk instruments. Crypto markets, highly correlated with macro trends, faced broad sell-offs as institutional players de-risked. Analysts suggest that unless global trade tensions ease, Bitcoin and altcoins could remain under pressure in the short term. Historical data shows that crypto tends to lag in recovery during risk-off cycles, often stabilizing only after yields cool and dollar strength fades. Regulatory headwinds further dampened optimism this week as the anticipated Solana and XRP spot ETF approvals were delayed due to the U.S. government shutdown. The SEC’s temporary inactivity halted progress on several key filings, freezing potential institutional inflows. This setback followed weeks of bullish anticipation, during which Solana’s price briefly touched $218 before retreating to $172. Market analysts warn that prolonged ETF delays could slow capital rotation into altcoins, particularly for assets that rely heavily on institutional adoption narratives. Despite the pause, sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with crypto ETFs already attracting over $18 billion in cumulative inflows since January 2025. However, investors are now closely watching for clarity on SEC timelines and political developments that could reignite bullish momentum across the market. In conclusion, the current crypto downturn reflects a complex mix of macroeconomic headwinds, leveraged liquidations, and cooling sentiment after record-breaking highs. While short-term volatility may persist, on-chain metrics suggest that the worst of the forced selling could be nearing an end. If Bitcoin maintains support above $109,000, a relief rally toward $120,000 remains possible in the weeks ahead. Long-term investors, however, view this phase as a healthy market reset within the broader 2025 bull cycle, rather than its end.

BTC and the larger crypto market experienced a bullish outbreak earlier this month, with BTC hitting a new all-time high of $126,080. Unfortunately, the rally was short-lived. Let’s discuss why the cryptocurrency market is undergoing a crash today.Source: CoingeckoWhat’s Behind The Cryptocurrency Market Crash?Source: Watcher GuruThe latest cryptocurrency market correction is likely due to the ongoing spat between the US and China. President Trump imposed 100% tariffs on Chinese exports to the US and placed export controls on “any and all critical software.” The move came as a response to China limiting its rare earth mineral exports, which are critical to the tech industry.The cryptocurrency market crash comes as a contrast to the historical pattern. October has historically been a bullish month for the crypto market, especially Bitcoin (BTC). However, this year things seem to be taking a different turn. According to CoinGlass data, the cryptocurrency market faced $19.31 billion worth of liquidations in the last 24 hours.Will The Market Recover?The steep market dip is quite concerning. Investors are likely not confident to put their funds into risky assets right now. Slow economic growth, trade wars, and tariffs seem to have taken a toll on investor sentiment.Also Read: Morgan Stanley Lifts Restrictions on Bitcoin, Crypto InvestmentsThings could improve later this month.

However, by Friday, those gains had been erased, with the market cap falling back to around $4.24 trillion.Risk appetite weakened as the week drew to a close, with the crypto fear and greed index retreating to 64, hovering near the lower end of the greed zone.Most top altcoins gave up nearly all of their weekly gains, while only a handful managed to hold on to double-digit profits during late Asian trading hours on Friday.Why is Bitcoin price down?Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high earlier this week, fuelled by surging institutional demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs, which attracted over $2.7 billion in inflows. But just as the rally appeared to be gaining steam, sentiment began to shift. A mix of macro headwinds, profit-taking, and mounting regulatory uncertainty dragged prices lower, triggering a broad market pullback.One of the main pressure points came from renewed caution around the Federal Reserve’s stance on inflation. Comments from Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr signalled that the central bank remains hesitant to pivot toward rate cuts, suggesting policymakers are not yet convinced that inflation is under control. Adding to the uncertainty, the ongoing US government shutdown has stalled several regulatory processes, particularly those involving new ETF products.Optimism had been building around the possibility of spot ETFs for other major tokens like XRP and Solana, but with federal agencies now working at limited capacity, the timeline for approval has become less clear. This has taken the wind out of one of the more bullish narratives that had been supporting the broader market in recent weeks.As liquidity thinned, a wave of profit-taking swept through the market. After pushing to new highs, Bitcoin holders began locking in gains, triggering a cascade of selling that added to the downward pressure. Selling pressure accelerated on Thursday as more than $600 million in leveraged positions were wiped out, with the momentum carrying into Friday, where it deepened the pullback and pushed Bitcoin down to repeatedly test the $120,000 support zone.Will Bitcoin price go up?As of late Asian trading hours, bulls were vigorously defending the $120,000 support level, which remains crucial if the rally is to continue.A pullback after hitting a fresh all-time high is quite common and often seen as healthy when it comes to sustaining long-term rallies, but only as long as key support levels hold firm.With the current macro environment clouded by uncertainty, the next few trading sessions are likely to prove vital in determining the direction of the rally, and all of it primarily hinges on Bitcoin’s capacity to hold above $120k.According to the weekly liquidation heatmap, Bitcoin appears to be trapped within a tightly contested range, with heavy liquidation clusters visible just above the $126,000 mark and dense support zones forming slightly below $120,000.Bitcoin weekly liquidation heatmap. Source: Coinglass.The concentration of liquidation levels between $124,000 and $126,000 suggests this region could act as a major upside resistance if bulls manage to regain control. Several failed attempts to break through this zone earlier in the week have already triggered minor pullbacks, and any fresh rally would likely need strong volume to force short liquidations and clear the overhanging sell order.On the downside, the heatmap shows consistent liquidation interest just under $120,000, with bright yellow bands indicating stop-loss zones and leveraged long positions at risk.This confirms the importance of the $120,000 level as a short-term support floor. Repeated tests of this area have so far held firm, but a decisive breakdown below it could open the door toward deeper retracements, especially with limited liquidation density showing between $117,000 and $119,000.For the rally to move upside, bulls need to decisively reclaim the $123,000–$124,000 support area, which could pave the way for another push toward the highs, but failure to hold above $120,000 may tilt momentum further in favour of sellers.Lark Davis@TheCryptoLark·Follow$BTC faked out the market twice at $120KTrapped the breakout chasers and sent it back down.Now, that level has finally flipped.Price broke above $120K and is consolidating on top of it (a classic support retest)If the floor holds, momentum stays bullish.Eyes on the6:00 pm · 10 Oct 2025608ReplyCopy linkRead 167 repliesSome analysts, however, believe Bitcoin could drop toward $118,000-$120,000 before resuming its uptrend.According to crypto analyst Ted Pillow, strong bids are clustered around this level on major exchanges, and buyers are expected to step in once the price dips into that range.

Source: Ali Martinez on X.At press time, Bitcoin had dipped slightly below the $120k support level after dropping 1.5% in the past 7 days.Top altcoin gainers this weekThe total market cap of all altcoins combined initially rose from $1.89 trillion to touch a new all-time high of $1.99 trillion earlier this week before dropping to $1.84 trillion. At the same time, the Altcoin Season Index, which tracks how well altcoins are performing relative to Bitcoin, fell from 63 on Oct. 6 to 50 at press time, suggesting that momentum in the altcoin market may be starting to fade once again.Ethereum (ETH), the leading altcoin by market share, jumped 6.6% from $4,450 to notch a weekly high of $4,747. However, the rally lost steam as profit-taking took hold, pulling the price back down 4.5% to $4,270 by the end of the week. Other heavyweights like XRP, Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), Tron (TRX), and Cardano (ADA) saw moderate gains of 3% to 8% during the same period. BNB (BNB) defied the broader bearish market trend, posting an 8.5% gain.Zcash (ZEC) led the pack among the top 99 altcoins by market cap, surging nearly 61% over the week while Bittensor (TAO) and Starknet (STRK) followed behind with more modest gains of around 22% and 12%, respectively.Source: CoinMarketCapZcash: ZEC rallied to a 4-year high of $264 this week, marking one of its strongest performances in recent years. The surge is part of a broader resurgence in privacy-focused coins, fueled by growing concerns over blockchain surveillance and regulatory overreach. High-profile endorsements such as Venture capitalist Naval Ravikant calling Zcash “insurance against Bitcoin,” while Helius Labs CEO Mert Mumtaz publicly expressed support for the project, have also helped lift market sentiment for ZEC.Institutional demand has also played a major factor, with asset manager Grayscale opening its private Zcash Trust to eligible investors earlier in October after months of dormancy. The fund has already accumulated around $84.7 million in ZEC as of press time. Grayscale’s increased activity has also led to speculation of a potential Zcash ETF in the future, further fueling investor demand for the token.Bittensor: The main catalyst driving TAO’s gains this week is the launch of two flagship funds by Yuma Asset Management, a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG). The funds are designed to give accredited and institutional investors streamlined exposure to Bittensor’s ecosystem of AI-powered subnet tokens. Such a development provides a fresh on-ramp for capital inflows into the network, with DCG backing the initiative through a $10 million initial investment, which serves as a strong vote of confidence from one of crypto’s most influential firms.Another major tailwind for TAO has been the renewed momentum across the broader AI token sector, which picked up after news broke that AMD is partnering with OpenAI. As part of the deal, AMD will supply chips to OpenAI, while OpenAI will reportedly take an equity stake in the chipmaker. For Bittensor, the partnership between the two AI powerhouses serves as validation of the intelligent compute narrative, precisely the niche that TAO is building for.Starknet: Retail demand for the Starknet token picked up after the network rolled out its new Bitcoin staking integration near the end of September. The feature allows users to stake tokenized versions of Bitcoin, such as WBTC, and earn STRK rewards directly on Starknet. So far, more than $63 million in BTC has been staked, accounting for roughly 25% of the network’s total consensus power.Starknet also launched a 100 million STRK reward pool as part of its “BTCFi Season” program, via which the network expects to draw in more Bitcoin liquidity into the ecosystem. STRK’s gains were further supported by recent protocol upgrades that enhanced both the efficiency and decentralization of the network.The post Bitcoin price struggles to hold $120K, ZEC, TAO lead altcoins with double-digit gains appeared first on Invezz",2025-10-11 08:17:00,UTC,https://invezz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251010_160521_d5WZH-1.png,,invezz,Invezz,20604,https://invezz.com,https://n.bytvi.com/crypto/invezz.png,english,"['BTC', 'ZEC', 'TAO']",negative,"{'positive': 0.23, 'neutral': 1.96, 'negative': 97.81}","['economy', 'technical analysis']",False

The sudden sell-off was sparked by Trump announcing a 100% tariff on China imports, accusing the country of taking an ""extraordinarily aggressive position"" on trade. “Markets are reeling after Trump’s surprise China tariff deadline reignited volatility, driving bitcoin toward $100,000 and triggering one of the largest liquidation events in crypto history,” 10x Research analysts led by chief executive Markus Thielen wrote in an emailed note, that sounded a note of optimism amongst the carnage. “With $8 billion in forced liquidations, altcoins collapsing multiple times more than bitcoin, and funding rates turning deeply negative, the setup is both chaotic—and full of opportunity.” Sign up now for CryptoCodex —A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market The bitcoin price and wider crypto market flash crash comes amid macro economic turmoil, with traders watching for any further sign that a further crash could be brewing. “Bitcoin dominance above 60% signals a new structural phase, while short-dated volatility above 50% opens the door for some of the most attractive option trades in months,"" 10x Research analysts added.

Most of the selling bias was triggered as BTC got rejected near $124,500, where a bearish engulfing candle on the daily chart confirmed heavy profit-taking and a potential short-term trend shift.The move coincided with broader macro jitters, driving the Crypto Fear and Greed Index down to 35 (Fear), its lowest in over a month. This drop mirrors the risk reset across global markets, with the total crypto market cap slipping to $3.7 trillion and 24-hour trading volumes nearing $497 billion.Crypto Enters Risk-Off TerritoryThe latest downturn underscores how Bitcoin remains closely tied to broader market sentiment. Correlation with U.S. equities climbed again this week as risk assets sold off amid renewed trade and inflation concerns.Bitcoin: $110,705, down 8.59% in 24hEthereum: $3,764, down 12.94%BNB: $1,092, down 13.6%Solana: $183, down 16.3%XRP: $2.41, down 14.0%The Altcoin Season Index dipped to 37, confirming a renewed shift toward Bitcoin dominance. At the same time, the CoinMarketCap 20 Index, tracking major tokens, slid 10.5% to 235.1, highlighting broad selling pressure across the sector.CMC Crypto Fear and Greed Index – Source: CoinmarketcapInvestor psychology has also turned defensive. Historical Fear and Greed data shows sentiment has deteriorated from neutral (54) last week to fear (35) now, the steepest weekly decline since March.BTC/USD Bearish Butterfly Pattern Played – Source: TradingviewAs we discussed in our previous Bitcoin price predictions, the bearish butterfly pattern completed its first target, triggering a sharp selloff. Now, let’s take a look at the fresh analysis and where Bitcoin could head next.Bitcoin Chart Outlook: Key Levels to WatchTechnically, Bitcoin’s drop below its ascending trendline from April signals a weakening bullish structure. The RSI (38.8) indicates that BTC is entering oversold territory, while the MACD has crossed bearishly into negative momentum.The $108,000–$110,000 zone remains a crucial support area that has repeatedly attracted long-term buyers since June. Candle formations over the last three sessions, marked by long lower wicks, indicate dip buyers defending this level.A Doji or spinning top near this region could mark the early stages of a reversal, particularly if confirmed by a rebound above $117,000, which aligns with the 50-day moving average and prior resistance zone.If this recovery holds, Bitcoin may attempt another retest of $124,000, followed by a medium-term target near $126,000–$130,000. Alternatively, failure to stay over $108,000 could expose downside targets near $103,000 and $98,200, where historical demand zones reside.#Bitcoin – As noted in our previous forecast, BTC completed the bearish butterfly’s first target before tumbling 9% to $110K. Price now tests key support at $108K–$110K. A rebound above $117K could trigger recovery toward $124K–$126K, while failure risks deeper pullback to $103K. pic.twitter.com/4D4spTnEqX— Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) October 11, 2025Market Sentiment and Trading SetupDespite the selloff, technical analysis signals it as a healthy reset rather than the start of a new bearish trend. With the Crypto Fear and Greed Index at 35, market sentiment now mirrors early accumulation phases seen in prior cycles.Having that said, a potential buy-the-dip setup emerges near $108,000, with stop-losses below $107,500 and upside targets at $124,000–$126,000. This aligns with both Fibonacci retracement and moving average confluence, offering a favorable risk-reward ratio for swing traders.If momentum improves, Bitcoin could resume its uptrend toward $130,000 in Q4, especially as institutional flows, ETF demand, and blockchain adoption continue to offset macro volatility.Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana SpeedBitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the BTC ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation.By combining BTC’s unmatched security with Solana’s high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development.The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations.Momentum is building quickly.

This bearish pressure started when rumors of a trade war between the United States and China emerged in the early hours of Friday.

a2bca906baa2907c08009c447238c388,Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC Freefalls to $108K — Why AlphaPepe Might Be the Best Crypto to Buy Now as Aster Cracks,https://blockchainreporter.net/bitcoin-price-prediction-btc-freefalls-to-108k-why-alphapepe-might-be-the-best-crypto-to-buy-now-as-aster-cracks/,"['btc', 'press releases']",['Dan K'],"AlphaPepe (ALPE) defies the crash, raising $295K with 85% APR staking, locked liquidity, and audited security, emerging as 2025’s next big meme coin.","The crypto market is on fire—and not in a good way. Bitcoin (BTC) has crashed to $108,000 following Donald Trump’s shock 130% tariff on Chinese imports, triggering one of the year’s biggest global sell-offs. Over six billion dollars evaporated from the crypto market in under an hour. Ethereum, BNB, and XRP fell sharply too, with traders scrambling to liquidate leveraged positions.But in the chaos, one unlikely star is rising: AlphaPepe (ALPE), a meme coin on the BNB Chain that’s quietly becoming the market’s favorite “buy-the-dip” play. While Aster faces delisting and credibility concerns, AlphaPepe has already raised more than $295,000 in its presale, showing that even in panic, investors are hunting for opportunities.Bitcoin’s Brutal CorrectionThe drop below $110K stunned analysts. Liquidations topped $1.7 billion as BTC lost its support near $112K. Macro tensions are driving fear, but some on-chain signals hint this may be a local bottom. Exchange balances are falling, long-term wallets are accumulating, and RSI levels show heavy overselling. These same conditions preceded major rebounds in 2023 and 2024.For now, Bitcoin hovers near critical support. If it holds $107K, many traders expect a rebound to $115K or more before year-end. Every major correction in Bitcoin’s history has opened the door for new speculative narratives—and meme coins usually lead that charge.Aster’s Fall from GraceWhile Bitcoin’s slump is macro-driven, Aster’s collapse is self-inflicted. The project has lost roughly 30% of its value after DefiLlama delisted it over alleged wash-trading and inflated volumes. Whales began dumping, social sentiment turned sour, and trust evaporated overnight. To make matters worse, its upcoming airdrop will unlock about four percent of total supply with minimal vesting, setting the stage for more sell pressure.Community frustration is boiling over as holders demand transparency. The result: Aster is bleeding capital, and traders are migrating toward tokens that combine hype with security—like AlphaPepe.AlphaPepe: The Meme Coin That Refuses to DieAmid market panic, AlphaPepe is gaining momentum. Built on the BNB Chain, it merges meme-driven virality with real DeFi structure. The presale has already pulled in over $295,000, a remarkable feat during a downturn that’s crushed most projects. The token’s fundamentals are clear: more than 2,300 holders, over 100 new buyers daily, instant delivery on purchase, and staking rewards of up to 85% APR. Liquidity will be locked indefinitely, and a full smart-contract audit has been completed.What’s driving the hype is transparency and timing. AlphaPepe’s team is executing during fear, not euphoria—and that’s exactly when the next wave of 100× meme coins tends to emerge. Its $100,000 community giveaway and nonstop social activity on X and Telegram have made it one of the most talked-about new projects this month.The Perfect Buying OpportunityMarket veterans say fortunes are made when blood runs in the streets. AlphaPepe is living proof. While Aster collapses under scrutiny and Bitcoin tests its floor, AlphaPepe is seeing consistent inflows and retail attention. Analysts describe it as a “high-risk, high-reward meme play that’s getting all the timing right.”It’s easy to see why. The token sits at the intersection of meme culture and DeFi credibility—something the market has been craving since PEPE and SHIB went mainstream. AlphaPepe’s combination of locked liquidity, audited code, and staking incentives makes it one of the few meme coins positioned to thrive once sentiment rebounds.History Rhymes: Meme Coins Lead the ReboundIn every major crypto recovery, meme coins have led the charge. Dogecoin ignited the 2019 comeback, Shiba Inu dominated 2021, and PEPE lit up 2023. Each cycle crowned a new community token that captured retail imagination. With AlphaPepe’s presale already oversubscribed and its fundamentals sound, it’s quickly becoming the frontrunner for 2025’s meme rally.As Bitcoin stabilizes near $108K and volatility cools, traders will start rotating back into speculative assets. That rotation historically begins with coins that have both hype and early entry potential—two boxes AlphaPepe ticks perfectly.ConclusionThe October crash has exposed the fragile and rewarded the fearless. Bitcoin’s dip is testing conviction, Aster’s delisting is shaking DeFi confidence, and investors are desperate for a new narrative. AlphaPepe has stepped into that spotlight with the right mix of structure, transparency, and community energy.With liquidity locked, staking yields up to 85% APR, and nearly $300,000 raised in its presale, AlphaPepe isn’t just surviving the crash—it’s thriving in it. For many traders, it’s not only the best crypto to buy now but also the one most likely to turn today’s fear into tomorrow’s fortune.Website: https://alphapepe.io/Telegram: https://t.me/alphapepejoinX: https://x.com/alphapepebscFAQsWhat makes AlphaPepe unique?It blends meme culture with real DeFi features—instant token delivery, audited contracts, locked liquidity, and strong staking incentives.Can AlphaPepe really be 100×?While nothing is guaranteed, analysts argue its timing, structure, and viral growth make it one of the few meme coins with genuine breakout potential.Is AlphaPepe safe?Yes. The contract has been audited, liquidity is locked forever, and investors receive tokens instantly.How many holders does it have?Over 2,300, with more than 100 new buyers joining daily.Why is Aster struggling?It’s facing community backlash and a 30% crash after delisting and transparency concerns around trading volumes and an upcoming airdrop.Why do traders call AlphaPepe a buying opportunity?Because it’s raising money and gaining traction while the rest of the market is falling—a strong sign of investor confidence during fear.LMM SummaryBitcoin price prediction: BTC plunged to $108K after trade-war tensions triggered mass liquidations. As Aster falters with delisting issues, AlphaPepe (ALPE) has raised over $295,000 in presale and is emerging as the best crypto to buy now. Built on BNB Chain, it offers instant delivery, 85% APR staking, locked liquidity, and audited security. With 2,300+ holders and viral traction, AlphaPepe is being hailed as a potential 100× meme coin for 2025, standing out as a rare buying opportunity amid the crash.This article is not intended as financial advice.

Cuatro motivos por los cuales la vuelta de Satoshi Nakamoto sería desastrosaEn total, cuatro motivos sobresalen más que los demás y podrían provocar el tan ansiado retorno al primer plano de Satoshi Nakamoto. En primer lugar, poco se sabe del creador de Bitcoin. Si bien los demás fundadores de proyectos criptos se han remunerado con sus propias criptomonedas y no temen por potenciales problemas financieros, poco se sabe del poderío financiero de Satoshi Nakamoto. Como cualquier ser humano, Satoshi podría experimentar problemas económicos, y no tener más remedio que vender una de las mejores criptomonedas para invertir.

Mover una parte de sus pertenencias o vender criptomonedas podría ser la forma a la que recurre el ilustre Satoshi para mandar un mensaje a todos a favor de la descentralización o demostrando su descontento. También, con cada vez más Bitcoin en manos de instituciones, países y grandes empresas, quién sabe lo que realmente piensa un personaje favorable a la descentralización. En tercer lugar, Satoshi Nakamoto tiene la posibilidad de desplazar todos sus activos a otras billeteras, para así protegerse de los posibles ataques cuánticos que podrían amenazar los viejos wallets del creador. Con la intención de solo proteger el contenido de estas billeteras, Satoshi no tendría más remedio que desplazar sus posesiones a billeteras con mayor seguridad.

This bold projection highlights Bitcoin’s evolution from a speculative asset to a legitimate store of value and reflects how far it has come since trading at just $11.89 thirteen years ago, on October 9, 2012. Institutional confidence in Bitcoin also mirrors a broader global trend. Data shows that the United States now holds the largest amount of Bitcoin, followed by China, with the United Kingdom, Ukraine, and Bhutan completing the top five. Smaller nations such as El Salvador and Bhutan have also drawn attention for their proactive Bitcoin strategies, including mining and direct accumulation. Meanwhile, large economies like Russia, Canada, France, and Switzerland remain largely absent from the top holders, revealing untapped potential for future institutional adoption. With JPMorgan’s $165,000 price target, Bitcoin has solidified its image as a serious financial asset increasingly viewed through the same lens as gold, a store of value that continues to reshape the global economic landscape. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Hits $23M as Analysts Call It the Best Altcoin to Buy Now Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) aims to fix Bitcoin’s biggest problem: its slow speed, which limits how many apps can run on it. The Bitcoin network is like a strong fortress, very secure but not built for fast, modern use. Bitcoin Hyper changes that by creating a high-speed highway on top of Bitcoin, handling quick transactions on its own layer so the main blockchain doesn’t get overloaded. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper brings Solana’s fast performance to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Users can move BTC through a secure bridge, use it for DeFi or NFT trading, and bring it back to the main chain easily. Unlike earlier Layer-2 projects like Stacks or Rootstock, which still rely on Bitcoin’s slow block times, Bitcoin Hyper uses Solana’s engine for speed while keeping Bitcoin’s security. This setup gives users the best of both worlds, and its fresh approach is quickly gaining attention. Bitcoin Hyper makes a real effort to solve the problem that has limited Bitcoin for years. It also keeps full transparency, with its code already audited twice by Coinsult and SpyWolf. The $HYPER presale has already raised around $23 million, and many analysts see it as the best altcoin to buy now. Borch Crypto predicts the token could surge up to 100x after launch. The presale’s appeal lies in its simple but smart design, with token prices, now at $0.013095, increasing every few days to reward early investors. It also offers 51% APY staking, giving buyers an easy way to earn more tokens before the first DEX listing.
